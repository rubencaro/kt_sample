# Kotlin Sample

Run `asdf install` to get versions of all base technologies.

Then run `\watch.sh` to run tests and rerun them on any file change.

__Now you are ready to start playing with the code.__

To add dependencies you should edit the `build.gradle.kts` file, and they will be resolved and installed before next test run.

Run `gradle tasks` to know what other tasks are available.
